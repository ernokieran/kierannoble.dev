                <p>In Component One of my Photography A-Level, I was given the topic of “Experimental Imagery”, which I interpreted as a way to try and bend the ‘rules’ of photography and create something that isn’t usually seen within the world of photography.</p>
                <p>Within this, I tried to investigate techniques new and old that aren’t seen much because they are often seen as “too experimental” or out of the contemporary world, within these themes I explored ways to portray the world and people in a way that may make the viewer think twice about what they are seeing as well as how it should make them feel.</p>

                    Initial Development
                </SectionTitle>
                <p>The project initially started with looking at how colour can affect a viewer’s experience of a photograph. Focusing first on how the lack of colour and artificial depth looks, before moving more into selective use of colour as well as creating artificial colour in a photo.</p>
                <p>During this process I began to look at how the shape of colour matters – using bokeh and colour together to control a viewer’s perception of a location. At this time, I also began to look into how video can be used to further increase a viewer’s connection to a location.</p>
                <p>After this I began to look into how I could ‘destroy’ a photo just enough to warp a viewer’s perception of an image, but not so much that it is no longer recognisable. One technique that I really liked, but ended up not making it into the final investigation was creating something that felt unnatural, but used human hands, the results of this can be seen below:</p>

                <p>As well as this, another favourite image of mine from this project is where I split the colours and blurred a model’s face to give a sense of broken and unrecognisable to the viewer – where they couldn’t see the facial features of the person but could see the rest in a ‘broken world’. The result of this can be seen below:</p>

                </SectionTitle>
                <p>Moving towards the end of the project, I began to once again look at how the world of photography, which is generally a snapshot of time in a single image, could move more towards the world of video and more so the motion of the world within the photographs.</p>
                <p>This method of motion in a single still photo was inspired by Mura Masa ‘s music video ‘What If I Go?’, which used a digital form of a style of 3D photography, popularised by the Nimslo 3D film camera from the 1980s, where I used the same moment in time but with multiple shots from slightly differing angles, to give a ‘frozen in time’ sense to the viewer, were they can see more than they should be able to. I then used these frames to create a looping gif, such as the ones below:</p>

                </SectionTitle>
                <p>From this, I developed a look that was similar to Super8 film, and incorporated it into a ‘music video’ style outcome, which used the techniques developed throughout the project to give a futuristic and old-fashioned contract to the viewer, within a confusing yet motion-filled outcome that bends the rules of photography and what is expected both from the artist and the viewer</p>
